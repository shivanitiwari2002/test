//* Application:  System DevOps Bridge-Interceptor eXtreme (BrIX)

//* Module Name:  Process Change Domain Bean
//*                                                                
//* Description:  This bean class provides the business logic for the condition
//*               when the source artifact being processed has a BRoute domain
//*               that was found, and it had an existing syncing Artifact Relationship,
//*               but the BRoute domain for the Artifact Relationship is different
//*               from the current BRoute domain. This implies the source artifact
//*               was changed such that the BRoute domain changed to another valid
//*               BRoute domain. This class handles the special processing that
//*               must be done to handle a change in BRoute domain.

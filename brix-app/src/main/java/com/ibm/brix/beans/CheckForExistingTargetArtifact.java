//* Application:  System DevOps Bridge-Interceptor eXtreme (BrIX)
//*
//* Module Name:  Check for Existing Target Artifact Bean
//*                                                                
//* Description:  This bean class provides the business logic for searching for
//*               an existing target artifact on the target endpoint system.
//*               This is done in the scenario we are potentially going to create
//*               a new target artifact on the target endpoint system, but perhaps
//*               by some failed previous processing, we had already created the
//*               target artifact. This code attempts to search for such an
//*               existing one, and if found, we need to use this target artifact
//*               to work with, rather than creating another new one.

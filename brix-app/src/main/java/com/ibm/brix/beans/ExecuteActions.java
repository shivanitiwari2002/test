//* Description:  This bean class provides the business logic for executing the
//*               list of atomic actions to be performed for this Exchange.
//*               The actions contain enough information on what the action
//*               is, and where it is to be performed (the target endpoint
//*               system, the source endpoint system, or something local to
//*               BrIX operational data), and calls the appropriate endpoint
//*               custom Camel component to perform the action.

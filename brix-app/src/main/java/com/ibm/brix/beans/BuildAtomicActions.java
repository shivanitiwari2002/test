//* Description:  This bean class provides the business logic for processing
//*               through the list of generated Actions, and grouping them
//*               into sets of atomic actions that can be performed as a whole
//*               via the appropriate custom endpoint Camel component.
//*               E.g. if there are multiple attribute updates for EWM, these can
//*               all be done in one "call" to the EWM component as a single
//*               save operation.
